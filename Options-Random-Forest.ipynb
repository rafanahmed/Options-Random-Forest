    "**Regression** is a type of machine learning that predicts a continuous numeric value, given a set of features. In our case, we use regression to forecast the realized move ($RM$, actual volatility) of a stock, using data such as option prices, historical price patterns, and more.\n",

    "- At each split in a tree, only a random subset of features is considered, making every tree see a slightly different part of the data.\n",

    "\\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} T_i(X)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "- The sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} T_i(X)$ means we add up the predictions from all the trees.\n",
    "- Finally, we divide by $N$ to take the average, so the Random Forest output is the mean of all the tree predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process helps the Random Forest provide more stable and accurate predictions by pooling together the results from many different trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We can use a Random Forest for this problem because:**\n",
    "- It can model highly **nonlinear relationships**—which are common in finance.\n",
    "- It’s highly effective for **tabular data** with many features (like ours).\n",
    "- It’s **robust to outliers and multicollinearity** (when features are correlated).\n",
    "- By averaging many trees, it reduces overfitting and variance (the **bias–variance trade-off**) without much need for feature scaling or heavy preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest also allows tuning parameters to improve performance:\n",
    "- `n_estimators`: Number of trees (more = smoother, more robust predictions)\n",
    "- `max_depth`, `max_features`: Control tree complexity and diversity\n",
