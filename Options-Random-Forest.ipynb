    "**Regression** is a type of machine learning that predicts a continuous numeric value, given a set of features. In our case, we use regression to forecast the realized move ($RM$, actual volatility) of a stock, using data such as option prices, historical price patterns, and more.\n",

    "A **Random Forest** is an ensemble learning method that builds many decision trees and averages their predictions. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each **decision tree** is trained on a random sample of the data (with replacement — aka bootstrapping).\n",
    "- At each split in a tree, only a random subset of features is considered, making every tree see a slightly different part of the data.\n",
    "- The **final prediction** is the average (for regression) of all trees’ predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a Random Forest, the prediction for an input $X$ is calculated as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} T_i(X)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "- $\\hat{y}$ is the final prediction made by the Random Forest.\n",

    "- $T_i(X)$ is the prediction for $X$ made by the $i$-th decision tree.\n",
    "- The sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} T_i(X)$ means we add up the predictions from all the trees.\n",
    "- Finally, we divide by $N$ to take the average, so the Random Forest output is the mean of all the tree predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process helps the Random Forest provide more stable and accurate predictions by pooling together the results from many different trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We can use a Random Forest for this problem because:**\n",
    "- It can model highly **nonlinear relationships**—which are common in finance.\n",
    "- It’s highly effective for **tabular data** with many features (like ours).\n",
    "- It’s **robust to outliers and multicollinearity** (when features are correlated).\n",
    "- By averaging many trees, it reduces overfitting and variance (the **bias–variance trade-off**) without much need for feature scaling or heavy preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest also allows tuning parameters to improve performance:\n",
    "- `n_estimators`: Number of trees (more = smoother, more robust predictions)\n",
